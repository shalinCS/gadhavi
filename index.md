## But why did he create us ?

I can’t stop thinking about this.Was It that he felt alone.But how can God feel alone.I mean he is the almighty.What was his motive in creating us?
Then I realised that I was searching for selfish reasons for the creation of universe.And I could find none to satisfy my rational thinking.

So it proves that god must be selfless.
And that is what makes him God !

And that is why we can never match up to him.We can never be as altruistic as God.He never discriminates nor does he ever satisfy his own thrist first.

Humans are born selfish because the ones who were selfless died in protecting others and their genes didn’t pass on. But this is not what God intended to create because this is actually a disadvantage to the society in extreme cases. And it’s extreme in over populated countries because there is always a competition for survival. And there you’d find people rude to strangers and foreigner. You’d also find people have no principles and no morals. That’s why the most populated cities have rude people. They are in such fierce competition that they can’t satisfy their own needs.

In the developing and undeveloped countries its common to see hot weather that makes people angry all the time. Maybe the hot weather causes them to not achieve success unitedly as a nation. Here people will help others only when they can help themselves first. This is inevitable. It might sound cruel when the airplane announcement say that first where your mask before assisting others but it’s actually necessary. This is how the world functions and it supposedly always will.
When you’ll look around you’ll see that big charities are done by only billionaires. And they’d be helping out only undeveloped or developing countries even if there are poor in developed countries.

But I feel that everyone should help others as much they can contribute because it will give you happiness. I have tried and seen that helping others does make you happy. Even the small gestures like saying hello or waiting for passengers to cross or just giving a smile. And I have seen that even the frowniest person smile back when I smile at him. The world is actually run by the people who are good. Empathy rules all and is the primary characteristic that separates us from animals.
