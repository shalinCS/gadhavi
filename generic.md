A University of Texas, Austin student working towards developing a more clear and vivid understanding of this world. My passion is to travel and detatch myself from past and the future. I want to permanently stay in this everchanging present moment.

Life has been grateful to be so interesting and diverse. It consists of all experience one's mind can imagine. But, don't let yourself drift so far because you can take up only one journey. So when you look back, instead of rating yourself higher or lower you can just overlook it.

Be grateful, humble and calm to all these motions in larger than yourself world. No impact in this world is comparable. But, it does compound upwards and debts down. Ironically, it behaves exactly the way money does. Always remember what goes around comes around!
